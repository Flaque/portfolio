        <h4> A graphics project in OpenGL and C++ </h4>

        <p> This project models and displays a simulation of a cloth attached to a
        hanger, as if it were curtains in front of a window.
        The goal of the project was to build our understanding of OpenGL and
        to ultimately to show off what we've
        learned in our Graphics course at Gonzaga University. The project works by representing vertices as "masses" and
          then treating each mass as if it were connected to its neighbors by
          a spring.  <a href="https://github.com/QuantamHD/OpenGL-Cloth-Simulation">
        The code for this project is on Gitub!</a></p>

          <h2> <a href="#caribu"> Caribu </a> </h2>
          <h4>The real-time HTML renderer on your desktop </h4>

        <p>Caribu is my current and most recent project. It's built on
        <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>, Github's platform for desktop
        application development, based on Chromium and running on Node.js.
        We hope that it will allow new
        developers a path beyond services like codecademy while still scaffolding
        their education by keeping away the messy alphabet soup of libraries and
        build services that come with real web development. </p>

        </p>Hopefully, users will
        be able to experiment with their ideas inside an environment that they're
        already comfortable in. Since we're a cross-platform desktop
        application running on macOS, Windows, and Linux, we're able to provide
        features that other web-based services cannot, like file-saving,
        keyboard shortcuts, larger screen sizes, and the use of another editor. </p>

        <img src="assets/images/caribu.png">

        <p>Caribu was built in a team with two other people. We take
        great care to avoid scalability problems that can often occur in
        Javascript applications. We set up strict file size conventions,
        require the use of ES6 modules, and encourage the use of documented
        utilities to avoid repeated code. </p>

        <p> Since we use Electron, we don't need to worry
        that much about cross-browser support, so we're free to use the newest
        CSS and JS.</p>

        <h2> <a href="#sposure"> Sposure </a> </h2>
        <h4> The iOS exposure therapy app </h4>

        <p> <img class="inline" src="assets/images/sposure/Full.png">
          Sposure was an app that my team and I created to help those with
        PTSD, phobias, and panic disorder. Although it was incredibly interesting
        to build, and is something we'd like to explore in the future, we eventually
        realized that it's core concept was flawed and wasn't incredibly functional.
        That wasn't before we had a solid first version running though!</p>

        <p>The app was built on the back of <a href="http://giphy.com/">Giphy</a>.
        The user would tap on what they were afraid of, we would query giphy
        for gifs of that thing, and then we would stream gifs concatenated on
        to each other for as long as the user held their finger on the screen.
        The goal was to give the user control over what they were afraid of. It
        was based on the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding_(psychology)">
        flooding therapy </a> which has been shown to be incredibly effective
        in many cases.

        <h4> Open Source</h4>
        <p> This project is open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/Flaque/Sposure">Github!</a> </p>

        <h4> Technical Details </h4>
        <p> We built the app in Swift, Apple's amazing new language for iOS. Like
        most of our iOS projects, we used <a href="https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire">
        Alamofire </a> for our HTTP requests. We also used
        <a href="https://github.com/xmartlabs/Eureka"> Eureka </a> for our
        tableviews. In order to loop and play gifs, I forked
        <a href="https://github.com/kirualex/SwiftyGif"> SwiftyGif </a> and built
        in the functionality.</p>

        <h5>Concurrency Model</h5>
        In order to not block the main UI process while it was running the GIF
        animation, I set up two concurrent modules that would run network processes
        in the background to preload gifs before the user got to them in their
        queue. The first was the <code>GiphyManager</code> that collected
        URLs from Giphy. The <code>GiphyManager</code> would then ship those URLs
        into a queue data structure, which could be dequeued by the
        <code> ImageManager </code> which would run on a separate concurrent queue
        in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/ConcurrencyProgrammingGuide/OperationQueues/OperationQueues.html">
        GCD</a>. The <code>ImageManager</code> could go grab the image from the URL,
        compile its data into an image object then ship it into another queue data structure
        that could be picked up by the main UI thread when the user gets to the
        end of the gif. <a target="_blank" href="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-01/14/1/enhanced/webdr06/anigif_enhanced-11836-1452753852-2_preview.gif">
        It worked a bit like this. </a>

        <h4> The golf course update </h4>

        <p> <img class="inline" src="assets/images/kptech/main.png"> KP Tech was a contract that we did for a local member of the Spokane
        community. We built two iOS applications to be used on a golf course
        in town. The first was an iPhone app that allowed users to order food
        from the kitchen in the main building. The second was an iPad app that
        allowed kitchen staff to see orders coming in and charge account numbers.</p>


        <h5> Technical details </h5>
        <p> We built KP Tech's app in Swift for iOS with a backend running in
          <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/">
        Phoenix</a>, a web framework built in <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">
        Elixir</a>, the Erlang derivative with Ruby-like syntax.</p>

        <h5> Design Work </h5>

        <p> As part of the project, I also built the original version of
        <a href="http://www.kptech.cc/"> kptech.cc</a>. And, I built a series
        of logos off their Helvetica font choice. In the photo below, you can
        see the styles that took a "K" to the final logo.

        <h2> <a href="#chow"> Chow Chow </a> </h2>
        <h4> The "actual" dining hall menu </h4>

        <p> We built Chow Chow as a way to help students at Gonzaga
        find out what was actually at the dining hall that day. We often found
        the current website did not actually have accurate information. It also
        didn't tell you how long you would have to wait or how good the food
        was that day.</p>

        <p> Users could post about meals that were available, the food quality,
        and the amount the had to wait.</p>

        <p>We learned a hard lesson about how difficult it is to build a crowd-sourced
          application. We figured that as long as we were going in everyday and
          posting meals, other people would eventually do so as well. Unfortunately,
          it became exceedingly difficult to constantly have to have the menu updated
          and also report on line times and food quality for everything the
          dining hall was offering.
       </p>

        <img src="assets/images/chow.png">

        <h4> Technical Details </h4>
        <p> We built Chow Chow in Swift for iOS. We used Alamofire for our HTTP
        requests and a Phoenix/Elixir backend. </p>
